I would like to express my deepest gratitude to all those who have supported me throughout the process of writing this thesis.

First and foremost, I am sincerely grateful to Prof. Dr. Marco Kuhrmann, my first supervisor, for his invaluable guidance, meticulous feedback, and generous commitment of time. His insightful comments and patient proofreading were instrumental in shaping this work.

I would also like to thank Philipp Straub, Research Assistant at Herman Hollerith Center BÃ¶blingen, for his expert assistance with experimental design and execution, for offering indispensable advice on literature research, and for his constant presence and support.

Finally, I owe my heartfelt thanks to my partner, Chelisa, whose unwavering patience and encouragement carried me through the many long days and nights of writing and programming. Her understanding and moral support made this journey possible.
